//C program before optimization:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int c = a + b * 2;
    printf("Result: %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
//In this program, the expression b * 2 is a constant expression and can be evaluated at compile time. After applying constant folding, the optimized program looks like this:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int c = a + 20; // b * 2 is replaced with 20
    printf("Result: %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
